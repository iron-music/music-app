## How does it work?
1. Every day you can post one of your favourite songs accompanied with the message you want to share with the community.

2. You will be able to rate all the daily songs and discover the most ratet song from the previous day.

3. At the end of the day all songs will disapear and the most rated one will become the song of the day!

## Highlights
- Search your favorite song thanks to the spotify api
- Listen to other people songs and rate them!!
- You can give one, two or three stars!!
- Create the post adding a message for the community
- The earlier you post the more time you have to get voted
- If you win your song will be displayed tomorrow for the whole day!!
- Sign up is necessary to post and vote but not for listening peopleâ€™s songs!

## Challenges and learnings
There were many technical and non-technical challenges here, but maybe the biggest one for us was the team collaboration and version control (**GIT**). Luckily, Alba had some experience and with few simple rules we could manage this without any major version conflicts. The communication was one of the keys to succeed here.

**Tips to do it right:**
- agree together on which files are being edited by each person
- ask before `merging` and let your team know, you've finished some `push`.
- always work on your new individual `branch` for each feature you are working on.
